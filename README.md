## üìÑ UTMath
*UTMath: Math Evaluation with **Unit Test** via Reasoning-to-Coding Thoughts*

*UTMath is a rigorous and expansive benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with an average of 68 test cases per problem to ensure that the model **truly solves the problem** rather than simply memorizing the answers.*
<ul>
    <li><b>‚ö°Ô∏èMultiple Case Validation</b>: Instead of using single cases that can be memorized, our questions are sequence-based, allowing numerous cases for validating true understanding.</li>
    <li><b>üîßTrue Reasoning Evaluation</b>: Hard cases and runtime metrics help filter memorization and compare solution efficiency, precisely assessing reasoning abilities.</li>
</ul>

*The Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach complements the UTMath Benchmark by encouraging LLMs to engage in explicit reasoning prior to generating code.RCoT significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution.*
<ul>
    <li><b>üèÜCode Output Evaluation</b>: We require LLMs to output code, focusing on reasoning rather than direct answers, to better reflect their reasoning skills.</li>
    <li><b>üåêObservation of Reasoning Process</b>: By mandating code implementation, we can observe and validate the LLM's reasoning process, not just the final answer.</li>
</ul>

In `data/utmath_problem.jsonl`, you'll find all 1053 problems from the UTMath benchmark, covering 9 mathematical domains. Each problem includes over 68 test cases.

## üìä Evaluating on UTMath

You can use this sample as a reference for evaluating on UTMath. Please use the following code:
```python
python utmath_eval/utmath_evaluator.py  --problem_file=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --sample_file={your_sample_file_path}
```

For example, you can directly use our response sample:
The file `data/sample_example/gpt-4o_sample.jsonl` contains responses generated using the RCoT method with GPT-4o on the UTMath benchmark. This sample includes responses to all 1053 problems.
```python
python utmath_eval/utmath_evaluator.py  --problem_file=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --sample_file=data/sample_example/gpt-4o_sample.jsonl

# --with_extra_data=True represents testing both easy and hard cases
# --with_extra_data=None represents testing only easy cases
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è RCoT Inference
We have preconfigured the environment to use OpenAI's API to call GPT-4o and apply the RCoT method for reasoning. After setting up your API key in the environment, you can enter the following command:
```python
python get_rcot_response.py --problem_path=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --save_path={your_save_file_path} --model_name={your_llm_name}
```
For example, after setting up the OpenAI API, you can use the following Python code to call GPT-4o and perform reasoning using the RCoT method.
```python
python get_rcot_response.py --problem_path=data/utmath_problem.jsonl --save_path=data/sample_exapmle/gpt-4o_test.jsonl --model_name=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
```


## ü•á Leaderboard
- The best model, GPT-4o, only solves 26.93\% problem in our benchmark, demonstrate the difficulty of our benchmarks.

Pass Rate and Average Run Time of LLMs on UTMath. We listed the performance of eight large models using PoT(Program of Thoughts) and RCoT methods across a range of metrics. The average run time is calculated based on the problems solved by the PoT or RCoT methods. The efficiency is calculated as: (Avg.Runtime(PoT) - Avg.Runtime(RcoT)) / Avg.Runtime(RcoT).

## üòé Some interesting findings
We conducted a comprehensive study with 8 LLMs. Some of our key findings are summarized as follows:

- Modern LLMs perform poorly in Graph Theory, Group Theory, Geometry and Topology.

Performance on Different Problem Categories.(%) Categories are represented by abbreviations. NT: Number Theory; T.: Theory; DM: Discrete Mathematics; CM: Combinatorial Mathematics; GT: Geometry and Topology; PSE: Polynomial and Series Expansions; SN: Special Numbers; FL: Formal Languages.

- RCoT can significantly improve the pass@k performance of LLMs. With RCoT, 7 of 8 evaluated LLMs generated more efficient solutions, with most models achieving higher scores.

Performance comparison of models across PoT and RCoT tasks at different pass@k levels.

- The quality of reasoning significantly impacts the accuracy and efficiency of the model's final solution.
![self-reasoning](./pic/self-reasoning.png)
Performance comparison between self-reasoning and using GPT-4o reasoning for coding across different models. The results show that models perform better when relying on GPT-4o's reasoning output.

We hope our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of current reasoning ability of LLMs and the further development of models.

## üëÄ Furthermore
*Additionally, we are releasing not only the UTMath benchmark but also the UTMath-Train dataset, consisting of over 70,000 problem-solving samples. This dataset is designed to support the community in further advancing research on mathematical reasoning and improving LLM performance in this domain.*
